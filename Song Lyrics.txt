Song lyrics
First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
I'm fired up, and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
It rained down like

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open, and it rained down
It rained down like

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer

Pain!
You break me down, and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive it came from
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
